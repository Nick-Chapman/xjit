# xjit

Explore JIT compilation in a low level language, whilst attempting to retaining coding in a high level language (Haskell).

The plan is for the LL language to have a somewhat Forthy feel.
The details of LL shall emerge a result of this exercise.
Along with an emulation for LL in Haskell.

Start with cat -- implemented at high level and low level.

Then brainfuck. implement in four ways:
- Interpreter (In Haskell) for BF.
- Compiler (In Haskell) from BF to LL
- Generate (In Haskell) Interpreter (In LL) for BF.
- Generate (In Haskell) Compiler (In LL) from BF to LL.

Now exactly sure what this will demonstrate.
Hopefully the later versions will retain the structure of the earlier versions.
